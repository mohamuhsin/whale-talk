# Whale Talk
Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.

The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.

Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.

To accomplish this translation, we can use our knowledge of loops. Let’s get started!

# Tasks

**1.** Create a variable named input that is equal to any phrase you’d like. This variable will contain the text you want to translate into “whale talk”.

**2.** Whales only speak with the vowels, “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, and “u”. Using these lowercase letters, create an array named vowels. This array will not be updated so be sure to choose the appropriate declaration keyword.

Note: The use of this array will be more apparent within the following steps.
